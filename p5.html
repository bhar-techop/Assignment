    <p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Pursuit of career in mathematics</strong></p>
    <p>In 1910, Ramanujan met deputy collector <mark style="color: blue; background-color: white;">V. Ramaswamy Aiyer,</mark> who founded the Indian Mathematical Society.<sup style="color: blue;">[52]</sup> Wishing for a job at<br>
    the revenue department where Aiyer worked, Ramanujan showed him his mathematics notebooks. As Aiyer later recalled:</p>
    
 <blockquote>
    <p>I was struck by the extraordinary mathematical results contained in [the notebooks]. I had no mind to smother his genius by<br> an appointment in the lowest rungs of the revenue department.<sup style="color:blue;">[53]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
    Aiyer sent Ramanujan, with letters of introduction, to his mathematician friends in Madras.<sup style="color: blue;">[52]</sup> Some of them looked at his work and<br> gave him letters of introduction to <mark style="color: blue; background-color: white;">R. Ramachandra Rao,</mark> the district collector for <mark style="color: blue; background-color: white;">Nellore</mark> and the secretary of the Indian Mathematical<br> Society.<sup style="color: blue;">[54][55][56]</sup> Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a<br> correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable <mark style="color: blue; background-color: white;">Bombay</mark> mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of<br> understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a fraud.<sup style="color: blue;">[57]</sup> Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's<br> doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed <mark style="color: blue; background-color: white;">elliptic<br> integrals, hypergeometric series,</mark> and his theory of <mark style="color: blue; background-color: white;">divergent series,</mark> which Rao said ultimately convinced him of Ramanujan's<br> brilliance.<sup style="color: blue;">[57]</sup> When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented<br> and sent him to Madras. He continued his research with Rao's financial aid. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in<br> the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.<sup style="color: blue;">[58]</sup>
 </p>

 <p>One of the first problems he posed in the journal<sup style="color: blue;">[30]</sup> was to find the value of:</p>

 <p>He waited for a solution to be offered in three issues, over six months, but failed to receive any. At<br> the end, Ramanujan supplied an incomplete<sup style="color: blue;">[59]</sup>solution to the problem himself. On page 105 of<br> his first notebook, he formulated an equation that could be used to solve the infinitely <mark style="color: blue; background-color: white;">nested<br> radicals</mark> problem.</p>

<p>Using this equation, the answer to the question posed in the Journal was simply 3, obtained by<br> setting x = 2, n = 1, and a = 0.<sup style="color: blue;">[60]</sup>Ramanujan wrote his first formal paper for the Journal on the<br> properties of <mark style="background-color: white; color: blue;">Bernoulli numbers.</mark>One property he discovered was that the denominators of the<br> fractions of Bernoulli numbers (sequence <mark style="background-color: white;color: blue;">A027642</mark> in the <mark style="background-color: white;color: blue;">OEIS</mark>) are always divisible by six. He also devised a method of calculating<br>B<sub>n</sub> based on previous Bernoulli numbers. One of these methods follows:</p>
<p>It will be observed that if n is even but not equal to zero,</p>
<blockquote>1.B<sub>n</sub> is a fraction and the numerator of ⁠B<sub>n</sub>/n in its lowest terms is a prime number,<br>
   2.the denominator of B⁠<sub>n</sub> contains each of the factors 2 and 3 once and only once,<br>
   3.2⁠<sup>n</sup>(2⁠<sup>n</sup> − 1)⁠B⁠<sub>n</sub>/n ⁠ is an integer and 2⁠(2⁠<sup>n</sup> − 1)⁠B⁠<sub>n</sub> consequently is an odd integer.</blockquote>
   <p>In his 17-page paper "Some Properties of Bernoulli's Numbers" (1911), Ramanujan gave three<br> proofs, two corollaries and three conjectures.<sup style="color: blue;">[61]</sup> His writing initially had many flaws. As Journal editor M. T. Narayana Iyengar noted:</p>
<blockquote>Mr. Ramanujan's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision, that the<br> ordinary [mathematical reader], unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could hardly follow him.<sup style="color: blue;">[62]</sup></blockquote>
<p>Ramanujan later wrote another paper and also continued to provide problems in the Journal.<sup style="color: blue;">[63]</sup>In early 1912,he got a temporary job<br> in the Madras <mark style="color: blue;background-color: white;">Accountant General</mark>'s office with a monthly salary of 20 rupees. He lasted only a few weeks.<sup style="color: blue;">[64]</sup>Toward the end of that<br> assignment, he applied for a position under the Chief Accountant of the <mark style="color: blue;background-color: white;">Madras Port Trust.</mark></p>
